<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Okay, unlike most authors I'd like to introduce myself, my name is Blake and I'm the guy that gets stuck in -----------.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The reason I'm sharing my story with you is because the publishers are willing to offer me a lot of money, I can't reveal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">how much money I'm being offered but trust me when you get a cheque this big there is no way you'd reject the offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So, you could say that I'm just writing it for the money (but also the publishers wouldn't leave me alone).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So this is how the story goes, me and my friends pass through some space-time portal and appear in a totally different</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>dimension. Even the love of my life is there (or at least that's what I call her). If you are anticipating any romance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">between her and me in this story I suggest you close the book and walk away because the only romance taking place was in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">between my crush and her dumb boyfriend (you didn't expect the twist did you). We also had a lot of problems, we had to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                             </span>Chapter-1 <span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>We get attacked by a flying pig (and no I don't think it was an hybrid of a wild boar and an eagle)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                  </span>Remember back in 2012 when everyone had a theory, where the earth would explode and everyone in it would die, they even made a movie based on it and called it 2012. Well, even though that theory didn't apply to you guys, it definitely to some extent applied to us because:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>(1) We were sent to another messed up dimension where we were very close to death at times</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>(2) If we didn't stop the villain the present earth would more or less explode.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>So anyway I haven't told you about my friends yet so let me get straight to it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Jack: Well this guy is my best friend, also you could say he is the most intelligent guy in the group. Good thing he was there with us cause we sure had a lot of deciphering to do when I say deciphering I mean he was trying to understand all the nerdish stuff. Also when it came to fighting he sucked (sorry bro!!!).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Elena: she is the girl I like or as I've told before she is the love of my life. I love her so much you could say I'm obsessed with her. Anyway, my personal opinion is that she is the prettiest woman alive (my opinion!!!!!!!), she is also pretty smart, she is very good at using daggers so she comes in handy for flirting and fighting (she'll kill me if she reads this).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: Oh!! this guy I don't even know where to start, this guy is like good at everything. for starters he is Elenaâ€™s boyfriend and he's pretty good looking (or as Elena says much better at looks than me), he is smart, he is pretty buff, he is okay in fighting (but not better than me) well if anything is bad about the guy it's that he doesnâ€™t know how to treat people nicely and that is one of the reasons i hate him a lot.He is like very rude to people..</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Dianna: she is probably the fiercest person I've met, she fights like a beast and even I'm really scared of her. she was really helpful when we were stuck in the alternate dimension and I guess she is also a pretty good person but she doesn't have a lot of emotions so she wasn't so helpful when we were depressed at times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>So I guess you get the basic idea about my friends so without any further ado let's get into the story. At that point in time, we were in college and we used to travel to college by the bus and one horrible day when we were done with college we were traveling home by bus and funny thing was only the five of us were present in the bus that day well including the driver of course. Everything was fine and nothing weird happened but things sometimes change really fast. Elena wasn't talking to me because of a fight we had and she always gets a lot of attention so I was sitting alone while the other guys were talking about their day and all the new school gossip. Then all of a sudden the bus starts shaking rapidly and I observe the driver is missing even Dianna notices it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Dianna: guys!!!! whoâ€™s driving the bus?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: what do you mean of course the driver is driving the bus.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>yeah no shit Sherlock!!!!! but the driver is missing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Well, how was the bus moving till now? We had no idea but then the bus<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>immediately lost control and it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>toppled over and all of a sudden we were flying outside the bus and we were falling down a cliff. At the bottom of the cliff I saw mist rotate around a circle of blackness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>through the circle we could see clouds with flashes red and blue. Sparks flew out of the circle and went sideways, like a tesla coil. I tried to find the others falling with me and i could see<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that most of them had blacked out, after that my memory was hazy, i guess i probably blacked out too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>I woke up with a slight pain in my body, the kind you get from sleeping in the wrong position. First thing i did was check if everybody was there, Second i checked if they were alive, i counted till four happily, and found alex lying on the ground, hoping that i donâ€™t count a five, i checked him, that goddamn guy was alive alright! Slowly the others woke up. after jack woke up i started noticing the surrounding, when i was checking on my friends i had assumed that this is just some normal forest near the route that we were travelling in, but i saw that i was completely wrong. These plants looked like normal plants but they were different, i couldnâ€™t tell exactly what, but i could feel it, something was off, but they were eerily similar to normal plants. Everybody had woken up, and they were checking out the surroundings. i just went to jack and he seemed bewildered. i helped him calm down a bit, then he seemed to be calculating something in his mind. i seemed to have forgotten about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>the circle and seemed to have ignored this eery feeling this forest gave me. Then i notice elena is hurt i was about to go to her to help her but alex went before me and i didnt want to be there anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>dianna: so does anyone know where the hell we are, last thing i remember is falling form the<span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span>bus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>alex: ya, and where is the bus?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>jack: and how did we survive such a big fall...</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: I think we've gone through some portal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: portal you must be out of your mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Elena: I think Blake is right when we were flying I caught a glimpse of some colorful force field.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>I didn't think Elena noticed it but it feels good to have her on my side once in a while.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: wait so you are saying that our driver magically disappeared and we were sent out of the bus flying and through the so-called portal that led us here</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>more or less yeah you're about right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Well I know it's like super weird this is not an era where people would believe in all this mystical shit but when people have theories of the world exploding (like 2012) you definitely have to believe this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>We were all silent for the next few minutes, we were looking around to find some answers about the place.the trees here were extremely huge and the plants were of a much darker shade of green than the usual ones.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>we were all tired and we wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. then all of a sudden we heard a noise i straight away didnâ€™t bother cause i saw Elena holding Alexâ€™s arm with fear and i lost my shit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>but turns out we were supposed to be worried cause the next second a horde of tribals holding spears came charging at us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>well since Jack was the smartest he moved forward raising his hands but Dianna had other plans. she took a giant rock in her arms and threw it at those tribals and like that everybody started fighting â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦...okay me and Elena didnâ€™t fight. Alex ran into the fight with full speed hoping to run into somebody but he just ran past the tribals and hit a tree. Jack not knowing what to do tried to punch some tribal but the tribal just lifted him up by his shirt. Dianna was actually the only one who was putting up a fight but even she got cornered by three of the tribals and Elena and me surrendered right away (what i was in a shock!!!!!). so basically the tribals<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>started saying somethingâ€¦..</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: guys i think i hit my head too hard i can't understand what they are saying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me: i think itâ€™s some kind of tribal language.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span>they tie the rest of the guys up too and start carrying us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Elena: any idea where they are taking us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me: iâ€™m no sherlock but i think they are taking us to their leader</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>that was the first time i spoke to her since our fight she just looked away. the place they were taking us had to be far cause they were tieing us to elephants so we could travel easily.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me: atleast on the bright side iâ€™ve never rode an elephant.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: yeah iâ€™d love to ride an elephant especially maybe WHEN MY FACE IS NOT ON ITS BUTT !!!!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me: okay i observe that youâ€™re in a bad mood so i'll stop talking</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Jack seemed pretty silent. he probably was upto his own calculations in getting out of here. but i was scared of one thing in movies usually when some kind of tribals capture the city folks they end up eating them. i hope that it doesn't happen here.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>it was a long ride (probably since elephants are big ,fat, lazy and slow animals) we had over a hundred stops. but we finally reached what looked like a big Kingdom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: woah look at the Kingdom itâ€™s huge</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Elena: yeah itâ€™s so pretty!!!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>i always hate it when they agree to each other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>we were taken inside the Kingdom everybody here was black (not being racist it was a tribal community). and exactly in the center of the Kingdom like weâ€™ve seen in the movies was what looked like a Kings palace it was either that or a 7 star hotel. they switched guards the new guards looked more muscular and more armored.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>the worst part about palaces is that you have to climb a long way up the stairs as if<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>the King wanted to torture his people just by making them walk up the stairs. so after climbing <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a billion steps!!!! we reached the throne room it was actually a pretty good room considering the fact that we just came from a forest. it had a lot of art on the walls and boy did the tribals have a very bad taste in art. they were a lot of women each five feet apart from each other standing at the sides of the room. and at the center of the room was the throne of the King it was huge and made out of gold, polished so it could shine in our eyes (what a showoff). and sitting on the throne was of course the King and he was wearing some fancy clothes. it was the mix of ancient and modern clothes.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: umâ€¦.. correction BROUGHT HERE!!!!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: okay what happened to the foreigners<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>King: well they were eaten of course</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Okay i totally lost my shit now. this is exactly what happens in the movies. i didnâ€™t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>know what to do. the windows were huge of course but they lead a long way down and i probably wouldn't have gotten past the guards either .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Jack: um.. sir i think there has been a mistake we are city folk we were travelling in a bus when all of a sudden it toppled over and we were sent flying through a portal which lead us here.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me: Yeah then all of a sudden your people came and captured us</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>King: hmm... thatâ€™s a very good story you got there but sadly I have a policy and that is to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>eat foreigners.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Okay I know what you guys are thinking right now<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>this King dude is pretty messed up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>We seriously needed to have a plan B right now. We werenâ€™t making any progress and the king was about to eat us alive or dead ( i hope it was dead).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king: guards take them away please.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>jack: wait<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>we are your guests we mean no harm donâ€™t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>you guys have some values towards your guests.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king: ahh what do you want!!!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: pretty much we want to live.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king: well i guess you have another option. we have a Battle Dome, someplace contenders fight for their freedom and we didnâ€™t have a fight from a long time and the people are also demanding it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but we donâ€™t know how to fight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king: okay how about this you guys team up to five and you guys fight against one of my contender.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: okay if we win we get to go free.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king: yeah of course.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>alex: and if we lose .</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king: oh thereâ€™s no losing ull die in the arena.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king : so are we on good terms</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: yeah i guess this is okay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>king: so the fight is tomorrow i<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>hope you enjoy your stay in the dungeons.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>the king clapped and the guards took us away, turns out the dungeon was all the way down the stairs so another painful journey but walking down the stairs was better as alex tripped over and rolled down a few flight of stairs. i didnâ€™t laugh from a lot of time so yeah that was good. turns out the dungeons were not as big as i thought it would be there were only two cells one filled with skeletons and the other seemed to be normal. we were sent into the normal one (thank god).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>alex: really blake!!! a fight</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: dude we had no other option he was definitely gonna eat us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">             </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>dianna: this is actually better no we have a chance of surviving all we have to do is beat one of his so called contender.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Elena: so yeah 5 against 1 the odds are in our favour we should be fine right.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Jack: umm yeah but we don't know how to fight.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Me: guys don't worry I have a plan but first we need to get some rest.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Well did I have a plan kindaa but me asking them to sleep was dumb cause even I didn't want to sleep in the dungeon the girls occupied one corner of the room and the guys the other corner but sadly the dungeon was very small so we didn't have much place I just lied down looking at the ceiling there was holes in it probably because we needed the air to breath through the holes as I observed was just one star which was weird but then again we were in some other dimension as I tried to focus onto the star my vision kept fading and then I just fell asleep. And yeah weird place weird dreams , I don't normally get dreams that often but that definitely was a messed up dream so basically in my dream I'm standing in a forest the same place where we landed but this time I was with only one other person I couldn't see his face just his back he was wearing some kind of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>1200s hoodie I guess it was full sleeved with cuts here and there his boots looked very old and very dirty as I tried to move to get a view of his face I heard a noise the same one I heard when the tribals came to capture us but this time there were more tribals than before they came circling the forest I didn't know what to do they came charging towards me and the other guy I tried to punch one of them in the stomach but my hand went right through him it was one of the weirdest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>feelings ever it felt like as if I didn't exist and then I realized that in this dream I didn't .I could only see but I couldn't do anything and nobody there could see me. yeah it was a weird Dream , so basically the tribals went straight through me to fight the other guy but before they could do anything the guy pulled out two swords and swung them so elegantly his body didnâ€™t move<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>an inch only his hands were moving and like that most of the tribals were down . one of the bigger tribal came charging at him he just jumped and dodged him, this bigger tribal looked real mad(ik its hard to keep reading the word tribals everywhere but there are so many of them and i donâ€™t have time to name them) so this big guy charges again but the super sword swinging guy just puts a sword straight through his heart splattering blood everywhere(thank god i actually didn't exist there i didn't want some guys blood all over me)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>the guy put his swords back inside his sleeve in a very cool way( wish i could do that) and then i wondered with the fight being over the crazy dream would be over to but no this guy looks at me as if i actually existed there so i thought i would be smart to say hi</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: ummmmâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦...hey iâ€™m on the good side(raising my hands)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>guy: uh-huh and which side is that.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>wow this guys accent was like very old and you could say it sounded same as a cowboyâ€™s accent now looking at his face i noticed he had blue eyes like the sea and he had a huge beard and a mustache.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me:umm yours i guess â€¦â€¦ see i'm just from another dimension and i just want to get back.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>guy: are you talking about earthâ€¦ cause you didnâ€™t go to some super dimension youâ€™re just on the other side of the earth. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>me: <span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>what ?? what do you mean the other sideâ€¦.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>and then my all of a sudden my vision started fading and i just passed out when i opened my eyes again it was jack there trying to wake me up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>jack: blake dude you gotta get up its time to head to the battle dome.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>I really wanted to understand what he meant by the other side of the earth but we had bigger problems to worry about.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Alex: so Blake what's the plan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>I actually forgot ABT the plan<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but luckily I watched a lot of action movies so I figured something out</span></p>
